# What's Cookin'?

This application allows users to view recipes from an assortment of various recipes. Users can save their favorite ones, and also search through the database by tag or by name if they are looking for a specific recipe. If the user clicks on a specific recipe card, they will be brought to the recipe page were the recipe details such as ingredients, instructions, tags and cost will be displayed.

## Learning Goals
As Mod 2 students in the Turing front end program, our learning goals were to further build on our knowledge of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript- particularly with implementing DRY and SRP code for the latter. This is also our first project in which we use data through an API, and incorporated it into our project.

We are also implimenting TDD or test driven development for the first time on a group project, so the goal was to create thourough tests for our functions that do not involve DOM manipulation or api calls.
